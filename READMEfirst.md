# Welcome to class! We're glad to have you in our program!

### First let's look around at where we are...

## Where am I?

The site you're at is codesandbox.io. It is an integrated cloud development environment. Wow! That's a bunch of words! Let's unpack that... An "Integrated Development Environment" (called an IDE for short because that's a huge name) is a space developers use to have all their tools visible at once and easy to jump between so they can work quickly and effectively. Codesandbox runs through your internet browser window which makes it an online IDE and is cloud based. Later in class you'll download, install, and use a software program that is an IDE that runs whether you're using your internet browser or not.

## User Interface

What's an interface? It's a place where a user interacts with a piece of techonology. There are a few main areas in within this interface.

The menu area to the left shows an index.js file and this "READMEfirst" file. This is your **`File Explorer`**. For this exercise you only need to work with and edit code within the index.js file.

The **`Editor`** section in the middle (where you're reading this at) is where you will be editing the index.js file. One thing that will likely look different from a normal text editor or word editor is that different portions of the code will be colored in different ways. This is called Syntax Highlighting and is useful when working in a code file to quickly identify the different parts of the code.

The **`Debug Console`** section below is where you will see output from any console.log code you write to test your code. After you read the rest of this page, you'll fork the assignment (instructions below). There are further details in the index.js on the console.logs, how/where to use them, and how to run your code, as well as more details below.

## Instructions

You'll need to fork this code to get started, but don't do it yet! Let's talk about what it means to fork code. Forking means making your own personal copy of a code base. Because your forked copy is _your_ copy, you can write your code without other people also using the code base seeing your answers and work. You can also go back to your assignments and make any edits or review your work at any time. For the next several weeks you'll fork the coding assignment for each week of class to make your own copy. You can find your copies of these assignments by clicking on the square in the top left of this website, then select "Dashboard". On the Dashboard page you should have an option on the left called "Recent". Your Dashboard should default to that, but if not, click it to see your forked Lessons.

Now you're ready to get started! Click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner. Once the workspace has been forked, you can rename it by going to the top middle where the workspace name is listed, select the down arrow, rename and rename to "Your Name Here - Lesson 1".

## Opening Index.js

If index.js is not already a tab available here in the Editor part of the interface after you fork the assignment, double click on the index.js file name in the Files panel on the left to open it. When you write code in the index.js file, the code will not run until you have saved (or until your file autosaved).

## Running and Debugging

Not many people like bugs, and in code, you don't want many - if any - bugs. Bugs can cause your code to NOT run as you expect or want. We call checking for these kinds of issues in your code and fixing them "debugging". You should use console.log to output values in the code when it is run to assist in debugging. For example, if you are having an issue with something related to the firstName variable you might add this line of code right below the variable to see what the actual value is at that point console.log('firstName variable is: ', firstName). Then run the file by clicking the Run button (the icon on the left with a play triangle with a bug on it). Then look at the output in the Console (bottom of the screen) to see your code output in the "Debug Console". We have console.log code written for your first few questions so you can see what to do. Be sure you follow that pattern for all of the other questions.

## Getting help

Refer to your lessons materials, contact class mentors, or reach out to your cohort leader(s) if you need any help. Happy coding!
